Upgear is the first French marketplace dedicated to airsoft in France

## How I got this idea ?

I was simply using a competitor's site indirectly and I found that the site was outdated. So I decided to make a more secure site, more pleasant to use.

## Stack that I used

The first version I made used React and Express. However I quickly realized that I need server side rendering.

So the tools I'm using right now are :

-   Next JS
-   Redux
-   Styled components
-   Go
-   The website is deployed on a VPS with Dokku software

## The problems I encountered

The main problem I encountered was related to the airsoft industry. I could not use facebook ads, google ads in order to acquire users. Also the payment managers for the marketplaces did not want to collaborate with me because they thought that this sector was too risky.

So I found a solution even if it changes a lot the experience I had imagined.

## The site In a few figures

-   More than 250 members
-   More than 25,000 euros of equipment put up for sale
